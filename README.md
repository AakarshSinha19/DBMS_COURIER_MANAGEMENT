# DBMS_COURIER_MANAGEMENT

A courier management system (CMS) is software that helps courier companies handle deliveries smoothly. It manages orders, assigns them to couriers efficiently, plans delivery routes, and lets customers track their packages. It also helps with tasks like getting proof of delivery and managing billing. In short, it makes the whole delivery process easier and more organized for everyone involved.
